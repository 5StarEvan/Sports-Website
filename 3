    Fix NBA web scraper: Switch to Basketball Reference, fix LeBron James stats
    
    - Changed web scraper from NBA.com to Basketball Reference for reliable data
    - Fixed duplicate player issue (traded players appeared multiple times)
    - Updated HTML parsing to correctly map Basketball Reference columns
    - LeBron James now shows correct 2024-25 stats: 24.4 PPG, 8.2 APG, 7.8 RPG
    - Retrained AI model with clean, deduplicated dataset (570 unique players)
    - Added deduplication logic to keep entry with most games played
    - AI predictions now realistic: predicts decline for 40-year-old LeBron
